# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

I am participating in the Advent of Code 2022 challenge: https://adventofcode.com/2022, and uploading my `python` code to this repository.
